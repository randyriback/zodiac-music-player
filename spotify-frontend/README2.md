## What is this?

This is a home for 12 custom-made Spotify playlists based on artists' astrological signs, curated by me. The photography and captions were done by Maurice Sarah in Melbourne, Australia.

## Why is this?

I found this to be a good excuse to tinker with the [spotify-web-api-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotify-web-api-node), a wrapper for the Spotify Web API, and well as [react-spotify-web-playback](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spotify-web-playback), a React component build with Spotify's Web Playback SDK. I also just wanted to showcase this archival music project somehow.
