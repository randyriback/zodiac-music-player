## What is this?

This is a home for 12 custom-made Spotify playlists based on artists' astrological signs that I'd curated. The photography and captions were done by Maurice Sarah in Melbourne, Australia.

## Why is this?

I found this to be a good excuse to tinker with the [spotify-web-api-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotify-web-api-node), a wrapper for the Spotify Web API, and well as [react-spotify-web-playback](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spotify-web-playback), a React component built with Spotify's Web Playback SDK. I also wanted to a way to showcase this archival music project.


## How to use:

1. Clone this repository

2. In both directories, simply run `npm i` to install all necessary dependencies

3. Navigate to **spotify-server** and run `npm run devStart`

4. Navigate to **spotify-frontend** and run `npm run start`
